## Why?

Building a notification layer is that thing that we as developers have to do for every new project. It's usually starts the same, sending just a simple email, and after a while you'll find your self managing hundreds of notifications across multiple channels. Notifire goal is to help developers create meaningful transactional communication between the product the users of it. All with an easy to use API and outstanding developer experience.

## Unified API

Today users tend to receive communication across multiple providers. Sendgrid for Email, Twilio for SMS, Mailchimp, Push, Web-Push, Direct messaging (Slack and etc..). The main reasoning behind this is that users expect to customize the communication channels to fit their needs and goals. This face developers to manage all of those API's across the codebase.
