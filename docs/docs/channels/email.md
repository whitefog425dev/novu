# Email

Novu can be used to deliver email message to your customers using a unified delivery API. You can easily integrate your favorite delivery provider using the built-in integration store.

## Configuring email providers
When creating an email provider integration you will be asked to provide additional fields alongside the provider-specific credentials:
- **Sender name** - Will be displayed as the sender of the message
- **From email address** - Emails sent using Novu will be sent using this address

For some email providers including SendGrid you will have to authenticate the **From email address** to make sure you will send email messages using an authorized address.

## Sending Email attachments
You can easily send attachments with the Novu API by passing the attachments array when triggering an Email based notification template.
