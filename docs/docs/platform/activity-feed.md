# Activity Feed

Novu provides a notification activity feed that monitors every outgoing message associated with its relevant metadata.
This can be used to monitor activity and discover potential issues with a specific provider or a channel type.

## Viewing a specific subscriber activity

To use a subscriber activity feed you can filter the feed by using the subscriberId or his email. This will show only the relevant data for this particular subscriber.

You can hover over the status icon to get additional information in case there was an error during delivery.

## Filter by template or channel

The activity feed allows you to filter messages based on the associated notification template or channel. This is helpful when you want to assess or debug a particular template and it's behaviour.

## Future plans for this page

In the upcoming releases we will update this page with more information regarding the stack trace of a notification template across the different providers. Follow us on GitHub to get the latest update on this.
