## Missing a provider? 

If you are in need of a provider we do not yet have, you can request a new one by [submitting an issue](#submitting-an-issue). Or you can build a new one by following our [create a provider guide](https://docs.novu.co/docs/community/create-provider).

## Submitting an issue

Before submitting a new issue, please search the issues and discussion tabs maybe an issue or discussion already exists and might inform you of workarounds, or you can give new information.

While we want to fix all the issues, before fixing a bug we need to be able to reproduce and confirm it. Please provide us with a minimal reproduction scenario using a repository or [Gist](https://gist.github.com/). Having a live, reproducible scenario gives us the information without asking questions back & forth with additional questions like:

- 3rd-party libraries and their versions, mainly providers, but not exclusively
- a use-case that fails

Without said minimal reproduction, we won't be able to investigate all issues, and the issue might not be resolved.

You can open a new issues with this new [issue form](https://github.com/novuhq/novu/issues/new).

# Missing a Feature?

If a feature is missing you can _request_ a new one by [submitting an issue](#submitting-an-issue) to our GitHub Repository. 
If you would like to _implement_ it, an issue with your proposal must be submitted first, to be sure that we can use it. Please consider:

## Coding rules

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:
- All features or bug fixes must be tested by one or more specs (unit-tests).
- We use [Eslint default rule guide](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/), with minor changes. An automated formatter is available (npm run format).
