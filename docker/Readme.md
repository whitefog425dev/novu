Docker is the easiest way to get started with self-hosted Novu.

## Before you begin

You need the following installed in your system:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and docker-compose
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quick Start

### Get the code

Clone the Novu repo and enter the docker directory locally:

```sh
# Get the code
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/novu-co/novu

# Go to the docker folder
cd novu/docker

# Copy the example env file to a solid
cp .env.example .env

# Start
docker-compose up
```

Now visit [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to start using Novu.


## Securing your setup

While we provided you with some example secrets for getting started, you should NEVER deploy your Novu setup using the defaults provided.

### Update Secrets

Update the `.env` file with your own secrets. In particular, these are required:

- `JWT_SECRET`: used by the API to generate JWT keys

## Configuration

To keep the setup simple, we made some choices that may not be optimal for production:

- the database is in the same machine as the servers
- the storage uses the filesystem backend instead of S3

We strongly recommend that you decouple your database
before deploying.
